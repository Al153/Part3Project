    \section{Reduced Type Derivation}
    A reduced type derivation is one where subtype and sub-effect rules must, and may only, occur at the root or directly above an \textbf{if}, or \textbf{apply} rule.

    In this section, I shall prove that there is at most one reduced derivation of $\gtyperelation{t}{\tau}$. Secondly, I shall present a function for generating reduced derivations from arbitrary typing derivations, in a way that does not change the denotations. These imply that all typing derivations of a type-relation have the same denotation.
