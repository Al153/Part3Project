I would like to thank my supervisors Alan Mycroft and Dylan McDermott for their time. Particularly, I thank Alan for his detailed feedback while writing this dissertation and Dylan for for his guidance with the more complex mathematical parts of this project.
I would also like to thank my director of studies, Rob Mullins, for his help and support over the last four years at Cambridge, which has undoubtedly improved my experience and the experiences of the other students here during my time.
