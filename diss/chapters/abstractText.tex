To date, there has been limited work on the semantics of languages with polymorphic effect systems. The application, by Moggi \cite{MoggiMonads}, of strong monads to modelling the semantics of effects has become a mainstream concept in functional programming languages. The usage of monads was made more precise by Katsumata \cite{Katsumata:2014} using a graded monad to model languages with a range of independent and dependent effects at an operational level. Separately, a categorical semantics for parametric polymorphism in types was first published by Reynolds \cite{PLCSemantics} allowing a denotational analysis of languages including type parameters. There has been some work on polymorphism over the exception effect by Benton and Buchlovsky \cite{PolymorphicExceptions}. However, there has been no work to date on the denotational semantics of languages with general parametric polymorphism over effects.

In this dissertation, I present several pieces of work. Firstly, I introduce a modern definition of a lambda-calculus-based language with an explicit graded monad to handle a variety of effects. This calculus is then extended with parameterisation over effects to yield a more general lambda calculus with polymorphism over effects. Next, I give an indexed-category-based denotational semantics for the language, along with an outline of a proof for the soundness of these semantics. Following this, I present a method of transforming a model of a non-polymorphic language into a model of the language with polymorphism over effects and a proof of adequacy for a model constructed according to this method.

The full proofs, though in a terser format, can be found in the online submission of this project, since due to the number of theorems and cases, the total size is well over 100 pages of definitions, theorems, and proofs.
