\begin{abstract}
\textsl{
	A category theoretic approach to build a graded monad based denotational semantics for a polymorphic effects system.
} 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction, approach and outcomes (500 words)}

\textsl{Provide an introduction to your project or essay. In particular, try to
  motivate the work and explain the relevant context (general
  background, as well as sufficient detail about any related
  work).}

\textsl{
Modelling effects of a program is crucial in modern optimising compiler design. It allows statements to be reordered or pruned and simplification of program structure.
}

\textsl{
Denotational semantics allows "full program" analysis
}

\textsl{
There already exist denotational semantics for non-polymorphic effects systems, but this may be improved by the use of polymorphism (c.f "Theorems for free" in polymorphic type systems)
}

\textsl{
Although semantics for polymorphic types is hard (russell's paradox) it is likely to be easier for effects as there is a lack of self recursion.

\comment {
What's the basic idea and approach? What are you thinking of  doing, and how is it going to solve the problem (or need) you've  identified. What are you going to ``produce''?  A project will typically produce one (or perhaps more) of the following: a piece of software, an evaluation of a published result, a proof, or the design (and perhaps the construction of) a new piece of hardware. An essay will typically either review and critique a particular area of the academic literature, or evaluate a published result or proof. Try to  name the specific things (and describe them) in this part of the  proposal -- this will allow you to refer to them in the next.} 

\section{Workplan (500 words)}
\comment{Project students have approximately 26 weeks between the approval of 
the proposal by the Head of Department, and the submission of the dissertation. This section
should account for what you intend to do during that time. You should divide the time into two-week chunks including dates, and 
describe the work to be done (and, as relevant, milestones to be 
achieved) in each chunk. You should leave two 
chunks for writing a project dissertation. You should leave 1 chunk for contingencies.}
