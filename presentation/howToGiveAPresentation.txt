How to give a scientific talk
- Most of the audience cannot refer to thing's you've already said
- Can't ask qs (3-4 qs max)
- therefore, lapses of attention damage comprehension
- therefore talk define about managing attention

    - talk too hard/easy
    - motive unclear

- managing attention with narrative
    - stories + raise further questions
    - only simple narrative needed 
    - for 20 min talk  
        - 6 min motivation
        - 3 min contributions + key ideas
        - 9 mins of explanation
        - 2 mins conclusion

    - motivation
        - Top down: here is a problem, how do we solve it?
            - start with a problem, obvious that a solution is needed to audience
            - motivate search for solution
            - danger 
                - fail to clearly articulate the problem 
                - take too long to explain the problem
        - bottom up: we have observations, which raise questions
            - interesting observations
            - surprising connections between them
            - motivates the search for an explanation

            - dangers
                - boring observatiosn
                - connection boring to non-experts

    The Goal
        - Give your approach to the problem
        - identify one key idea of your solution
            - not zero
                - need to explain to something new
                - doesn't answer problem
            - not n+2
                - many papers require several innovations
                - find a unified way to describe this as one idea
                - otherwise the audience will be confused
    divide and conquer
        - divide the explanation into segment
        - treat each segment as mini talk  
            - motivation, idea, explanantion, conclusion
        - remind audience of what you did and why
