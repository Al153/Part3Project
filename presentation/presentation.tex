How to give a scientific talk
- Most of the audience cannot refer to thing's you've alreay selectfont
- Can't ask qs (3-4 qs max)
- therefore, lapses of attention damage comprehension
- therefore talk define about managing attention

    - talk too hard/easy
    - motive unclear

- managing attention with narrative
    - stories + raise further questions
    - only simple narrative needed 
    - for 20 min talk  
        - 6 min motivation
        - 3 min contributions + key ideas
        - 9 mins of explanation
        - 2 mins conclusion

    - motivation
        - Top down: here is a problem, how do we solve it?
            - start with a problem, obvious that a solution is needed to audience
            - motivate search for solution
            - danger 
                - fail to clearly articulate the problem 
                - take too long to explain the problem
        - bottom up: we have observations, which raise questions
            - interesting observations
            - surprising connections between them
            - motivates the search for an explanation

            - dangers
                - boring observatiosn
                - connection boring to non-experts

    The Goal
        - Give your approach to the problem
        - identify one key idea of your solution
            - not zero
                - need to explain to something new
                - doesn't answer problem
            - not n+2
                - many papers require several innovations
                - find a unified way to describe this as one idea
                - otherwise the audience will be confused
    divide and conquer
        - divide the explanation into segment
        - treat each segment as mini talk  
            - motivation, idea, explanantion, conclusion
        - remind audience of what you did and why

        - Imagine you're a compiler trying to analyse the side effects of this \texttt{doAction} function here.

        - You're not having the best of times
        - it's used three times with three different side effect - one's irrevocable - you can't speculatively execute it, one alters control flow, and the last accesses immutable state so you can do all sorts of optimisations.
        
        - Using some simple  analysis, you can create three separate instantiations of the function to analyse, so it's not too difficult in this case.
        - However in programs with higher order functions, creating these separate instantiations is undecidable in general

        - With a polymorphic effect system, it becomes a bit easier to analyse programs like this. But how do you know that your tools and optimisations are sound?

\begin{frame}{What is denotational Semantics? }
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A mapping $\deno{-}: \text{Language Structure} \rightarrow \text{Mathematical Structure}$
        \item In particular want to define $\deno{\gtyperelation{t}{A}}$
        \item Needs to be \textit{compositional}, \textit{sound}
        \item And \textit{adequate} for our needs
    \end{itemize}

    \script{
        - Denotational semantics is where we create a mapping between program terms and an abstract mathematical structure.
        - We want this to be compositional - meaning that each term's denotation is defined in terms of its subterms 
        - It should also be sound, meaning that equivalent program terms up-for, for example, beta-eta reduction, have equal denotations.
        - we also want it to be adequate - if two terms have equal denotations, then that should mean something useful about the relation of the two terms (e.g. can replace one by the other, etc)

        \item $\deno{A}, \deno{\G} \in\obj\C$
        \item $\deno{\gtyperelation{t}{A}}: \deno{\G}\rightarrow \deno{A}$
    \end{itemize}


    \script{
        - In part II, we used domains to handle the semantics of non-termination. Lurking beneath this notion is the idea that we can use category theoretic structure to construct our denotations.

        - Here we map types and type environments to objects in a particular category, and correctly typed terms to morphisms (arrows) in the category.

        - One more structure we need is a functor - a map of objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms that preserves composition of terms.

\begin{frame}{Language features (1) - Lambda Calculus}

        A cartesian closed category (CCC) consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Products $A\times B$ - models tuples
            \item A terminal object $\1$ - models the \U\texttt{  }type
            \item Exponential objects $B^A$ - models functions as first-class objects
        \end{itemize}

        \script{
            Now let's look at what category theoretic structure you need to model different language features.
            
            - For lambda calculus style languages, you need at least a cartesian closed category.

            - In terms of the category of sets, this gives you sets of pairs of objects, sets of functions, and the single element set.

            - These are used to model pairs, lambda terms, giving us higher order functions, and the terminal, single element set allows us to interpret the unit type and ground terms.
        }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Language features (2.A) - Monads}
        A (strong) monad consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A functor $\T{}{}: \C\rightarrow \C$
            \item Join and Unit natural transformations
            \begin{itemize}
                \item  $\bindmu_{A}: \T{}{\T{}{A}}\rightarrow \T{}{A}$
                \item $\point{A}: A\rightarrow \T{}{A}$
            \end{itemize}
            \item Tensor strength natural transformation $\strengtht_{A, B}: A\times\T{}{B}\rightarrow \T{}{(A\times B)}$
        \end{itemize}
        
        \script{
            - To handle effectful computations in a pure language like haskell, you need to use something called a monad.

            - This actually comes from when Moggi first discovered how to model effectful programs.
            - You need this structure of a functor from your category to itself, together with some natural transformation operations for creating and composing effectful operations.
            - If you squint a bit, they even look like the programming language monad definition.

            - An issue with haskell is that each monad only gives you one effect. If you want a program that does IO, contains state, has exceptions, and does non-determinism, you end up with a stack of monads.
            - This is still imprecise for meaningful analysis
        }

\begin{frame}{Language features (2.B) - Graded Monads}
    A (strong) graded monad consists of:

            \item Indexed Join and Unit natural transformations
            \begin{itemize}
                \item  $\bind{\e_1}{\e_2}{A}: \T{\e_1}{\T{\e_2}{A}}\rightarrow \T{\e_1\dot \e_2}{A}$\
                \item $\point{A}: A\rightarrow \T{\1}{A}$

        \script{
            - A solution is a graded monad.

    - Morphisms: $\deno{e}: \1\rightarrow U$
    - Monoidal operator $\Mul: \ciu\times\ciu\rightarrow\ciu$
    - Can represent each effect environment as an object $I$, and common transformations between environments, such as weakening and substitutions, are morphisms between effect environments.

    \script{
        - So we need a way of reasoning about the transformations of effect-variable environments in a category theoretic manner
        - To do this, we need a base category, containing a terminal object, an object $U$ representing the kind of effects, and finite products on $U$ 
        - $U^n$ represents the effect-variable environment of length $n$. We'll now use $I$ to indicate this.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can we actually instantiate a category with the required structure? 
        \item Starting point a model of EC in $\set$
    \end{itemize}
    
    \script{
        - So far, we've only said what structures are required to model PEC.
        - Haven't shown that there actually exists an indexed category with the required properties
        - so let's do that
        - It's fairly well known that you can instantiate models of languages with the same features as EC in the category of sets and functions
        - We want to extend one of these models into one for PEC
    }

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (2) - Base Category}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $\Eff$ - category of monotone functions of tuples of ground effects to ground effects
    \item $\deno{\typerelation{\nil,\a, \b}{\b\dot(\a\dot\texttt{IO})}{\effect}} = (e_1, e_2)\mapsto e_2\dot(e_1\dot\texttt{IO})$
    \item $\Mul(f, g)\ev = (f\ev)\dot(g\ev) $
\end{itemize}

    \script{
        - Firstly, we want to build a base category
        - to do this, we shall consider the category of monotone functions taking vectors of ground effects and returning ground effects
        - We construct the multiplication operator using the $\dot$ monoid operator from the EC spec
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (3) - Fibres}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The fibre $\C(n)$ is the category of functors $[E^n, \set]$
        \item I.E. objects are functions that take a vector of ground effects and return a set.
        \item Morphisms are functions that return functions in $\set$
        \item S-Category features
    \end{itemize}

    \script{
        - Now we can think about the fibres
        - These are functor categories
        - I.E. their objects are functions returning sets and their morphisms are dependently typed functions
        - We can construct all the of the S-Category structure  as pointwise
    }

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (4) - Functors and Adjunctions}

    Re-indexing functors act by pre-composition
    \begin{align*}
        A\in&\quad [E^n, \set]\\
        \theta\star(A) \emv =&\quad  A(\theta(\emv))\\
        \theta\star(f) \emv =&\quad f(\theta(\emv)): \theta\star(A) \rightarrow \theta\star(B)\\
    \end{align*}


    The quantification functor takes a product over all ground effects
    \begin{align*}
        \allEn(A)\env =&\Pi_{\e\in E}{A(\env, \e)}
    \end{align*}

    \script{
        - Finally, we need to construct the various functors
        - Reindexing functors are done using precomposition
        - quantification consists of a product over all ground effects
    }
