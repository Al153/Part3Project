    (Objects, Morphisms, etc)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Language features (1)}
        cartesian closed categories - pairs, unit, and functions
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Language features (2)}
        Monads, graded monads    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Language Features (3)}
    Subtyping, Subeffecting, If-Expressions
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Effectful Language}
    EC Syntax + example program    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Semantics of EC}
    - example of some denotational rules
    - S-Category
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Ugly Example}
    - Example of a program that would benefit from polymorphism.    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Let's add polymorphism}
    - PEC Syntax, Type System (Particularly Gen and Spec rules)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Ugly Example - With a Makeover}
- Example of a program that would benefit from polymorphism.  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do we Model the Semantics of a Polymorphic Language?}
    - For a given effect variable environment $\P$, excluding the polymorphic terms, we have EC, which there exist models for.
    - Effect-variable environments of length $n$ are isomorphic by $\a$-equivalence
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do we Model the Semantics of a Polymorphic Language?}
(So we can build up stack of S-categories)
(diagram of the category stack)
("Need to have a way of moving between S-categories")
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Base Category}
    - We need a way of reasoning about effect-variable environment categorically

    - We can model effects and environments in new category.

    - Objects: $\1$, $U$, $U^n$ (write I for $U^n$)
    - Morphisms: $\deno{e}: \1\rightarrow U$
    - Monoidal operator $\Mul: \ciu\times\ciu\rightarrow\ciu$
    - Can represent each effect environment as an object $I$, and common transformations between environments, such as weakening and substitutions, are morphisms between effect environments.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Indexed Category}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quantification}

\end{frame}
    
\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (1)}
    - Can we actually instantiate a category with the required structure?

    - Models of particular instantiations of EC based on $\set$ exist.

    - Next step is use a $\set$-based model to build a model of EC
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (2) - Base Category}
    - Category of monotone functions of ground effects (with no variables) to ground effects.
    - $\deno{\typerelation{\nil,\a}{\a\dot\texttt{IO}}{\effect}} = e\mapsto e\dot\texttt{IO}$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (3) - Fibres}
    - The fibre $\C(n)$ is the category of functors $[E^n, \set]$
    - I.E. objects are functions that take a vector of ground effects and return sets
    - Morphisms are functions that return functions in $\set$
    - S-Category features (products, exponentials, graded monad) can be constructed pointwise
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Instantiating a Model (4) - Functors and Adjunctions}
    - Re-indexing functors are formed by pre-composition
    - $\allEn$ functor is formed by a product over all effects.
    - Adjunction operations become pairing and projection.
\end{frame}
