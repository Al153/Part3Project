        - Imagine you're a compiler trying to analyse the side effects of this \texttt{doAction} function here.

        - You're not having the best of times
        - it's used three times with three different side effect - one's irrevocable - you can't speculatively execute it, one alters control flow, and the last accesses immutable state so you can do all sorts of optimisations.
        
        - Using some simple  analysis, you can create three separate instantiations of the function to analyse, so it's not too difficult in this case.
        - However in programs with higher order functions, creating these separate instantiations is undecidable in general

        - With a polymorphic effect system, it becomes a bit easier to analyse programs like this. But how do you know that your tools and optimisations are sound?
