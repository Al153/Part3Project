    \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{3em}
        \item A sound set of requirements for denotational semantics of effect-polymorphic languages.
        \item A method to construct models for effect-polymorphic languages in $\set$.
        \item A proof of adequacy of such a model.
    \end{itemize}

        - There are three main contributions here
            - A set of requirements to make a sound model of an effect polymorphic language
            - A construction of models for polymorphic languages in the category of Sets
            - And for a particular language I've proved adequacy.
