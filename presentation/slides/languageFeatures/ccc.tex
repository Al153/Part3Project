        A cartesian closed category (CCC) consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{3em}
            \item Products $A\times B$ - models tuples
            \item A terminal object $\1$ - models the \U\texttt{  }type
            \item Exponential objects $B^A$ - models functions as first-class objects
        \end{itemize}

        \script{
            Now let's look at what category theoretic structure you need to model different language features.
            
            - For lambda calculus style languages, you need at least a cartesian closed category.

            - In terms of the category of sets, this gives you sets of pairs of objects, sets of functions, and the single element set.

            - These are used to model pairs, lambda terms, giving us higher order functions, and the terminal, single element set allows us to interpret the unit type and ground terms.
