        \item What about effect-generalisation?
        \item $\ntreeruleI{Effect-Gen}{\etyperelation{\P,\a}{\G}{v}{A}}{\etyperelation{\P}{\G}{\elam{\a}{v}}{\all{\a}{A}}}$
        \item Need to map $\deno{\etyperelation{\P,\a}{\G}{v}{A}}$ to $\deno{\etyperelation{\P}{\G}{\elam{\a}{v}}{\all{\a}{A}}}$
        \item For specialisation to work, needs: $\pstar\dashv\allI$
    \end{itemize}


    
    \script{
        - We now need to think about the polymorphic terms
        - For quantification, we need another functor, $\allI$ which maps a type rule with an extra effect variable to one quantified over that variable
        - In order for specialisation to work, this quantification functor needs to be a right adjoint to the opposite operation of weakening the effect environment
        - Adjunction of functors is essentially a weaker version of an isomorphism of the categories they're between.
        - Going out on one functor and coming back on the other isn't quite the same as the identity, but it has a well defined action.
